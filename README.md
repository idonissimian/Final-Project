# Final-Project
Final project of B.Sc. studies:
-	Research and practical project in the field of graph theory that aims to research complex networks which it's properties are very similar to real-world networks' properties. 
-	The project is including development and implementation of algorithms in order to provide a solution to various problems in graph theory: the hamiltonian problem, the clique problem and the maximal-cut problem.
-	In addition, the project is including research and implementation of models with real-world-like properties, focusing on the properties of the models and how the algorithms work on them.
